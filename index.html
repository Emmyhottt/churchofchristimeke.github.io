            <p><b>The Church of Christ are independent Christian congregations linked with one another through distinguished beliefs and practices</b></p><p><B>represented worldwide as one of the various denominations to evolve out of the American Restoration Movement, they declare biblical foundation for their doctrine and practice and outline their legacy back to the early Christian church as expressed in the New Testament.</B></p>
            <p><b>The American Restoration Movement of the 19th century began with the merging of various independent contingents to return to apostolic Christianity. Two were of critical significance to the advancement of the movement. The first, driven by Barton W. Stone started at Cane Ridge, Kentucky and named themselves solely as "Christians". The second started in western Pennsylvania and was headed by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander Campbell. They adopted the name "Disciples of Christ". Both groups tried to restore the whole Christian church on the doctrine set forth in the New Testament, and both thought that creeds held Christianity divided.
Despite their variations, the two movements agreed on numerous decisive concerns</b></p> <p><b>Both saw restoring the early church as a path to Christian freedom, and both believed that solidarity among Christians could be accomplished by using apostolic Christianity as a basis. The dedication of both factions to reviving the early church and to unifying Christians was enough to inspire a union among many in the two movements. However, early in the 20th century, the Restoration Movement broke apart into different groups, primarily the "Church of Christ," "Christian Church," and "Disciples of Christ."</b></p><p><b>Despite being influenced by the Restoration Movement, individuals of the Church of Christ do not consider themselves as a new church originating near the beginning of the 19th century. Rather, the whole movement is designed to represent in modern times the church first established on Pentecost, A.D. 30. The strength of their conviction rests in the renewal of Christ's original church</b></p>

            <p>Churches of Christ seek to follow the teachings of the Bible being the only source to find doctrine (known abroad as sola scriptura). Churches of Christ commonly see the Bible as historically authentic and accurate, unless the written context clearly designates differently. Regarding church disciplines, worship, and tradition, there is notable freedom from congregation to congregation in deciphering what is biblically admissible, as congregations are not regulated by a denominational authority. Their method to the Bible is inspired by the "assumption that the Bible is sufficiently plain and simple to render its message obvious to any sincere believer". Linked to this is a presumption that the Bible presents an understandable "blueprint" or "constitution" for the church.</p>

            <p><b>Churches of Christ regularly teach that the process of salvation comprises the subsequent actions:</b></p>
            <p><b>- One must be properly taught, and hear (Romans 10:14-17);</b></p>
            <p><b>- One must believe or have faith (Hebrews 11:6, Mark 16:16);</b></p>
            <p><b>- One must repent, which means turning from one's former lifestyle and choosing God's ways (Acts 17:30);</b></p>
            <p><b>- One must confess belief that Jesus is the son of God (Acts 8:36-37);</b></p>
            <p><b>- One must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38); and</b></p>
            <p><b>- One must live faithfully as a Christian (1 Peter 2:9).</b></p>

            <p><b>"A cappella" singing is the only music used in worship.
                As an outcome of the distinguishing plea of the church - a return to New Testament Faith and practice - acapella singing is the only music utilized in worship. This singing, unaccompanied by inanimate instruments of music, corresponds to the music used in the apostolic church and for numerous centuries thereafter (Ephesians 5:19). It is believed that there is no jurisdiction for involving in acts of worship not found in the New Testament. This belief excludes the use of instrumental music, along with the use of candles, incense, and other comparable elements.</b></p>
